# Laptop-Review-System
This project involves exploratory data analysis and outlier removal on a laptop reviews dataset. Using correlation heatmaps, boxplots, and the IQR method, we identified and removed anomalies to improve data quality. The cleaned dataset ensures more accurate insights, better visualization, and a solid foundation for further analysis or modeling.
